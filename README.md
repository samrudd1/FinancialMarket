# FinancialMarket

Hi, this is my simulated financial market based on the auction model that implements some AI trading strategies on top of it.

To run the market you need a MySQL database, with the IP address in the src/main/java/utilities/PropertiesLabels class.

Alternatively, to run the market without a database, checkout https://github.com/samrudd1/FinancialMarketNoDB

to run the market, start the main method in src/main/java/trade/RunMarket and remember to build the project with the pom.xml file to have all dependencies installed.

Thanks for checking my project out!

Sam Rudd
